# DN-IEEE802.11DCF-TP
Implementing IEEE802.11DCF-TP 

\title Introduction
DN-IEEE802.11DCF-TP, or Distributed Neighbor Discovery-IEEE 802.11 Distributed Coordination Function-Transmission Power, is a technique used to improve the performance of wireless networks by reducing the amount of collisions that occur.

DN-IEEE802.11DCF-TP works by allowing nodes to dynamically adjust their transmission power based on the number of neighboring nodes that are also transmitting. This helps to ensure that only one node is transmitting at a time, which reduces the number of collisions.

\title Main Takeaways and Contribution
In this project, we estimate the throughput of IEEE protocol both in theory and simulation.
